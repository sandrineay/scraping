# 1. Create a 'members.csv' file at the same level as the file path of this 'emails_meetup_scraper.rb'
# 2. Install some gems. Open your terminal and run: 'gem install nokogiri', 'gem install mechanize', 'gem install json'
# 3. Give us the following information:

# Your Meetup credentials as strings - you need to be an administrator for your Meetup Group
signin_email = 'adresse.stuff@email.com'
signin_password = 'your_meetup_password'

# Number of members on your meetup group as an integer
meetup_members_nb = 1753

# Your meetup group urlname as a string: in https://www.meetup.com/Le-Wagon-Berlin-Coding-Bootcamp/ it's Le-Wagon-Berlin-Coding-Bootcamp
urlname = 'Le-Wagon-Berlin-Coding-Bootcamp'

# 4. Then launch 'ruby emails_meetup_scraper.rb', wait for the "All done!" success message
# 5. Once you're done open "members.csv" and there you go, all your meetup members who chose to give you an email address are in there!
